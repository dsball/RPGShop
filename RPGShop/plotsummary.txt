Echo Mirage was inserted into the Arcology weeks before the shutdown. It was a 
relatively routine espionage job. The Johnson gave you some directions and a 
list of files to "acquire," but that all went out the window when the blast 
doors dropped and the lights went out. Emergency lighting flickered on. 

A calm, professional voice droned over the facility's PA:
"Due to unforseen circumstances, this facility has indefinitely severed 
ties with the outside world. Further information will be provided as necessary." 

The PA clicked as the mic closed its connection and the world was quiet. 
It took days before the facility settled, and in that time people seemd to be 
disappearing. Nobody saw where they went, or heard them leave; they were 
there, then gone. The team couldn't work like this and decided it was best to
wait until things settled before they continued their mission.
